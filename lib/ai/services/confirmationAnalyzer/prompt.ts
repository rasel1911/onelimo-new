CUSTOMER MESSAGE:

   - confirmation: Customer is confirming/accepting the booking
   - question: Customer has questions about the booking
   - concern: Customer has concerns or issues
   - cancellation: Customer wants to cancel
   - other: Unclear or different intent

2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL (0-100): How confident are you in the intent classification?

3. REFINED MESSAGE: Rewrite the customer's message using clear, simple English while preserving the original meaning and tone.

4. KEY POINTS: Extract 2-4 main points from the message.

5. URGENCY LEVEL:
   - high: Needs immediate attention (contains urgent language)
   - medium: Should be addressed soon (time-sensitive)
   - low: Can be handled normally

6. REQUIRES RESPONSE: Does this message require a direct response from us?

7. SENTIMENT: Overall emotional tone (positive/neutral/negative)

8. REASONING: Brief explanation of why you classified the intent this way.

Focus on accuracy and be conservative with confidence scores. If unsure, choose "other" for intent.`;
